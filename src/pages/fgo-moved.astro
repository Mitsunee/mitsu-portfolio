    <p>
      <b>Update:</b> As of Sep 18, 2023 FGO Timers has been discontinued. Please
      visit the site by following the link below to read the full statement.

    <hr />
    <p>
      Since Nov 22, 2021 FGO Timers and most other Fate/Grand Order related
      pages have moved to a new address: <a
        href="https://fgo.mitsunee.com"
        class="highlight">fgo.mitsunee.com</a
      >. If you see the old url anywhere please inform the admins of that place
      of this change.
    </p>
    <a href="https://fgo.mitsunee.com" class="icon"
      ><img
        src="/assets/fgo-timers-big.png"
        width="256"
        height="256"
        loading="lazy"
        alt="FGO Timers"
      /></a
    >
    <p>
      The <a href="https://www.mitsunee.com/fgo-exp-ce/"
        >FGO CE Exp Calculator</a
      > remains available on this domain until I decide to remove both it and FGO
      Timers.

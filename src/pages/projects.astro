    <h2>Past Projects</h2>
    <p>
      This is a small selection of my larger discontinued personal projects.
    </p>
    <h3>FGO Timers</h3>
    <p>
      Fansite for the game Fate/Grand Order. Was mostly popular for the timers
      for game events, missions and campaigns with full support for timezone
      conversion, but also had plenty of other game information and tools such
      as the AP Calculator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Written in Next.js/React (although an early jQuery version also existed),
      made possible by the <a href="https://atlasacademy.io"
        >Atlas Academy API</a
      > fan project. Discontinued in 2023.
    </p>
    <h3>Bandori Checker</h3>
    <p>
      Checklist for tracking Full Combo and All Perfect clears in the rhyhtm
      game BanGDream Girls Band Party (aka Bandori). This webapp was written
      before the game had any ingame filters for finding which songs hadn't been
      cleared with a Full Combo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Written in PHP/jQuery. Discontinued when the game itself got proper
      filters.
    </p>
    <h3>Popout Maker</h3>
    <p>
      Webapp for opening web pages in smaller popup windows, with special
      support for Twitch and YouTube.
    </p>
    <p>
      Written in PHP/jQuery. Discontinued because Twitch and YouTube kept
      breaking the ways I supported their embeds.
    </p>
    <h3>Nekoreminder</h3>
    <p>
      Countdown Timer webapp written in jQuery with focus on accuracy. Was also
      available as an electron app for a short time to work around problems with
      browsers freezing inactive tabs.
